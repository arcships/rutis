//! The second stage of a runtime: rows start only once their declarations
//! are complete.
//!
//! A row resolved before its runtime was running has no schema and none of
//! the dependencies its plugin declares, since only the runtime can read
//! them. Were rows to start as soon as the runtime does, such a row could
//! run before a service it injects is there. So the runtime provides
//! `Runtime` first; this plugin then resolves those rows again and
//! only afterwards provides [`RuntimeRows`], which every row depends
//! on. Rows waiting for it do not start while they are reloaded.
