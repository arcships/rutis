//! Plugins of other languages as loader rows, each language in its own
//! runtime process: one on this machine (`rutis_bridge::runtime::LocalRuntime`,
//! the process started by the local transport and its session over a link),
//! or one elsewhere ([`RuntimePlugin::remote`], its session over a link to
//! it). Either way the rows are the same.
//!
//! The runtime is a rutis plugin the application mounts first, then the
//! loader, then a [`RuntimeRowsPlugin`] per runtime; every row depends on the
//! [`RuntimeRows`] service that plugin provides once the rows' declarations
//! are complete, so rows wait for their runtime and stop when its process
//! goes away. Each row is loaded and disposed on its own.
//!
//! - **Node** (feature `node`, [`RuntimeResolver::node`]): all rows load into
//!   one Cordis Context, so they resolve each other's services natively, as
//!   in dsh. A row names an npm package (resolved from the runtime's anchor
//!   `package.json`, `exports` honored), a subpath of one, or a file
//!   (`file://`, absolute). Its `isolate` and `inject` name Cordis services,
//!   so the resolver handles them itself (`Resolved::foreign_scope`) and
//!   forwards them. Its schemastery `Config` becomes the row's JSON Schema
//!   (`meta.volatile` → `x-volatile`), and a volatile-only change is handed
//!   to Cordis, which commits it in place and emits `loader/volatile-update`
//!   to the plugin, as dsh's loader does.
//! - **Python** (feature `python`, [`RuntimeResolver::modules`]): a row named
//!   `py:<module>` loads that module as a leaf plugin.
//!
//! Services cross between the rows and the rest of rutis by name, as
//! `dyn HostDispatch` at `host_key(name)`:
//!
//! - a service the plugin injects gates the row in rutis, and the row leases
//!   it into its runtime while it runs. In a leaf runtime (Python) every
//!   injected name does; in Cordis only the names the catalog registers as
//!   shared ([`ServiceCatalog::register_shared`]), the others are left to
//!   Cordis;
//! - the services the plugin declares it provides are published from the
//!   row's own fiber, so Rust plugins and other runtimes' rows can inject
//!   them.
//!
//! A shared name inside instances ([`ServiceCatalog::register_shared_instance`])
//! is each instance's own: a copy gates, leases and publishes it at
//! `host_key_in(name, instance)`, and in the runtime process it isolates
//! the name under its instance's label, so rows of other instances, which
//! share the process, do not see it.
