//! Shuttle models of the three places in the kernel where an interleaving
//! has gone wrong before (#179; standard Q6.1.3, risk K2). Shuttle runs the
//! threads below one at a time and picks who runs next at every sync
//! operation it controls, so each iteration tries one interleaving, and a
//! failing one is printed as a schedule that `shuttle::replay` runs again.
//!
//! The models run the kernel's own code, not a copy of it: `TransitionTask`
//! and `join_task`, [`post_join_to`] (what `FiberInner::post_join` runs),
//! `EffectRecord::{claim, finish, join}` (what `EffectRecord::drain` runs),
//! and — for registration, event flights and the close passes — a real `Ctx`
//! built on a tokio runtime handle, so `register_effect_named`,
//! `Entry::start`, `set_state` and `wait_events` are the kernel's too. Models
//! 7–9 and 12 are reference models: their comments say which bookkeeping
//! cannot be run here and what stands in for it; models 10 and 11 run the
//! bus's `Table`, `Selected` and `Entry` and mirror the emit chain and the
//! notice delivery. Model 13 runs a record drained early against the unload
//! that takes its list; model 14 pins what several completions do to one task;
//! model 15 mirrors `load`/`unload` to check the live generation the kernel
//! publishes across restarts. Built with `--cfg rutis_shuttle`, `crate::sync`
//! makes the driver's `alive` flag, a fiber's `lineage_closed` marker and an
//! effect record's state shuttle primitives; the tokio channels in between
//! (`watch`, `mpsc`, `Notify`) need no runtime and are single steps to shuttle.
//! Shuttle switches just before an operation on its primitives, so the windows
//! the code guards that no primitive opens are marked with
//! `crate::sync::switch_point()` (nothing in a plain build): between
//! `post_join`'s check and its send, between an effect join's check and its
//! wait, and inside an effect factory, between the two registration checks.
//! What stands in for the rest of the fiber (the driver's exit, `drain()`'s
//! spawned runner, the unload's async steps) is written out below, each next
//! to the code it follows.
//!
//! Run (CONTRIBUTING.md):
//!
//! ```text
//! RUSTFLAGS="--cfg rutis_shuttle" cargo test -p rutis --lib \
//!     --target-dir target/shuttle shuttle
//! ```
//!
//! `RUTIS_SHUTTLE_ITERATIONS` sets the iterations of each scheduler: 1000
//! by default, as on pull requests; the nightly run (`stress.yml`) uses a
//! million. A failure prints its schedule (`failing schedule: "…"`);
//! `RUTIS_SHUTTLE_REPLAY=<schedule>` replays it, with the failing test's
//! name as the filter.
