//! Where a runtime process's standard streams go: its input is none unless
//! its launcher gives it this process's (for a plugin that reads the
//! terminal), and its output and error are this process's unless discarded.
//! Both ways a runtime is started: `LocalRuntime` and the `Process` facade
//! (`Mount::launcher`).
//!
//! Its own test binary: while a probe runs, the test points this process's
//! standard input at a pipe holding a line, and its output and error at a
//! file. The probe copies what it reads, writes a line to each stream, and
//! exits (so the start fails: it never greets).
