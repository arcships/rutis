//! Trace validation for the session channel (#624, `docs/formal-trace.md`
//! §2, §3.1–§3.8, §4): an execution is a trace, and a trace is allowed only
//! if every event in it is one the previous events allow.
//!
//! Three sequences are checked here.
//!
//! - The channel trace `channel::trace` writes: direction, length and how a
//!   channel ended, never its bytes. A close ends both directions of this
//!   end; a far end that ended its stream is not followed by another
//!   message; a failed send ends sending; a failed receive ends the message
//!   stream.
//! - The frames themselves, decoded by the fixture that wraps a channel:
//!   a greeting first and once, protocol 4, no frame before it; a call id
//!   carrying the prefix of the session that issued it, and each session
//!   numbering its own calls (a replacement numbers them from 1 again); a
//!   reply only for a call the same session's far end opened, at most once;
//!   a cancel for a call this side does not have is the one dangling name
//!   allowed (it may cross the reply it cancels).
//! - A lease's steps beside the channels, recorded by the fixture: the
//!   newer handshake, the old session's unload, the newer session's install
//!   and a stale command's refusal; the old channel closes as replaced
//!   before its far plugins are unloaded, and they are unloaded before the
//!   newer session mounts.
//!
//! What frames grant and carry is checked with them:
//!
//! - §3.3, references: a `call`/`get`/`await` names a reference the far end
//!   granted and has not seen fully released; a `release` counts against
//!   those grants and no further; a granted identity is one a session
//!   allocates (1 to 2^53−1); a reference sent home names one its session
//!   granted. Each is a session-level fault when broken, not a call's.
//! - §3.5, failures: a `throw` carries a name and a message, and a graph
//!   whose root names a node — the code and data a program decides by. A
//!   graph that does not resolve is taken as `bad graph` and fails only its
//!   call; the frame stays in the trace, the session goes on.
//! - §3.6, limits: a frame is within the channel's message limit, because a
//!   session checks before writing it. So an over-limit value fails its
//!   call and leaves no frame; a message over the limit that reaches the
//!   carrier ends the channel, which the channel trace shows. The two are
//!   different results, and the trace records only the size either way.
//! - §3.8, replacement: a replaced channel closes with `replaced` and its
//!   session's ending is retryable; a rejected identity and an
//!   incompatible version are not. A replacement is a new session, its
//!   calls numbered from 1 again; a reply on it for an id the session it
//!   replaced opened is not a reply in it. What ends a session is
//!   classified by the error's kind, never by its text
//!   (`crates/rutis-host/src/connect/session.rs:56-61`).
//! - §3.8, leases (`specs/remote-lease/RemoteLease.tla`: `OneLease`,
//!   `OldCommandsStayOld`, `CleanBeforeHello`): a newer connection's
//!   handshake completes while the old lease still serves; the old session
//!   then unloads, its far plugins with it, its channel closes as
//!   `replaced`, and only then does the newer session mount. A command of
//!   the old lease after that is refused before it crosses. The host's
//!   listener that makes this order (`crates/rutis-host/src/connect/
//!   listen.rs:4-10`) is in another crate; the fixture mounts the sessions
//!   in that order and the lease events it records are checked.
//! - §3.8, a host gone: the channel ends normally, the call in flight
//!   fails with a transport error (code `peer-gone`), the session ends with
//!   `peer disconnected`, and no frame follows the far end's end.
//! - §3.4, synchronous waits: a forward into a one-stack, non-reentrant
//!   runtime with a call out, not on the forward's chain, would wait on
//!   itself; the session does not send it and its caller gets
//!   `SyncWaitCycle`. The chain and stack-order edges need the runtime's
//!   stack, which a channel trace does not carry, so only this edge is
//!   checked.
//! - §3.8, an access point: a greeting names the end it is on — a
//!   connection greeting as another endpoint is not an admitted session; a
//!   revoked identity is closed with `rejected` (4003) after its hello and
//!   ends as an identity refusal, nothing crossing after it. The old
//!   `AccessEvent` log was removed with #695 and today's listener is in
//!   `rutis-host`, so these are the endings this crate sees of an
//!   admission, not the point's own log.
//!
//! Every allowed trace here was produced by a real channel or session, or
//! is the literal sequence of a replacement, whose two channels are
//! checked apart, as are the repeated close and the repeated end no run
//! here makes. A lease's trace is the channels' lines plus the fixture's
//! steps beside them (a handshake, an unload, an install), which is how the
//! host's order becomes visible without a channel event for it. Every
//! forbidden one is that same trace with one event changed, or a literal
//! sequence. The product trace stays size-only: the fixture decodes frames,
//! the trace does not, because messages carry configuration. Each forbidden
//! case is one this file's rule for it rejects — the channel's own where a
//! line is the fault — and where a case names a rule, deleting that rule
//! accepts it.
//!
//! Not checked here, and gaps of #624: path forwarding, the outbound
//! backlog limit (`SessionOptions::outbound_limit`: only a host makes a
//! session with it, `Connection::open_with` is not public), which reference
//! kinds a frame may name (a `get` of a function is the far end's own
//! refusal), the access point's own log
//! (`specs/remote-lease/AccessPoint.tla`; removed with #695), the chain and
//! stack-order edges of the wait graph, and the host's real listener (its
//! order is the fixture's). 4002 and 4003 are checked through a memory
//! channel, whose `Close` maps them; the WebSocket close codes themselves
//! are `crates/rutis-bridge/tests/websocket.rs` (feature `websocket`, not
//! built here). The retry classes are the ones
//! `crates/rutis-host/src/connect/session.rs:56-61` and the Go dialer
//! (`go/rutis/internal/runtime/dial.go`, `sessionFailure`) decide by; this
//! file checks the endings those classes are made from.
