//!
//! A runtime's session comes from a link, wherever the runtime runs:
//! [`LocalRuntime`] starts one on this machine (the local transport starts
//! the process, a link carries its session); [`RuntimePlugin::remote`] uses
//! one elsewhere, through the session [`RuntimeAccessPlugin`] provides from
//! a link to it. Either way the rows are the same.

// Inside the crate, runtime code names session items through this module.
