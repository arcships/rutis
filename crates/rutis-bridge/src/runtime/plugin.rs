//! A language runtime as a rutis plugin: one process, whose lifetime is the
//! plugin's. The Node runtime runs an empty Cordis Context
//! ([`RuntimePlugin::node`], feature `node`); the Python runtime runs leaf
//! plugins ([`RuntimePlugin::python`], feature `python`). Both speak the
//! same protocol and row contract, so nothing below depends on the language.
//!
//! Plugins loaded into it one by one (`Process::load_row`) depend on the
//! [`Runtime`] service, so they wait for the runtime natively and stop
//! when it goes away. The runtime itself depends on nothing: each plugin
//! leases the host services it uses (`Process::lease_host`), so the waiting
//! falls on that plugin, and runtimes never wait for each other.
