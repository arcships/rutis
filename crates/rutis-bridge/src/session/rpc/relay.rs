//! Relays: references of one session forwarded to another.
//!
//! A reference imported on session A and sent to session B is exported on
//! B as a relay of the same kind; B's calls, reads and awaits on it are
//! forwarded to A with the call chain rebased (`rebase`). The relay holds
//! the import, so releasing the relay releases the original on A. A relay
//! coming back to Rust is the import itself, and an import sent back to its
//! own session goes home as before.
