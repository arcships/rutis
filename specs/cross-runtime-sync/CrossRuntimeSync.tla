CONSTANTS
    Runtimes,   \* runtime sessions (model values)
    Reentrant,  \* runtimes that run every incoming call while waiting
    Policy,     \* "current" | "A" | "B" | "Bchain" (B without stack order)
    Rebase,     \* TRUE: Rust rewrites `path` as rpc.rs `rebase`; FALSE: verbatim
    MaxRoots,   \* top-level activations (timers, events) over the whole run
    MaxDepth,   \* hops in one call chain
    MaxCalls,   \* calls one activation makes, one after another
    MaxPosts,   \* emits and synchronous dispatches over the whole run
    Threaded,   \* runtimes with a thread (or task) per incoming call: Go, Swift, Kotlin
    Declared,   \* runtimes whose far end declares `sync-wait`; others are outside the check
    EmitChain,  \* TRUE: an emit's listener call carries the emitter's chain; FALSE: it does not
    DispatchMode,\* "none" | "bail" | "waterfall": synchronous event dispatch
    DispatchHop,\* TRUE: Rust records the dispatch as a forwarded call; FALSE: it does not
    HostRoot,   \* TRUE: the host makes its own synchronous calls (a Rust plugin's)
    HostHop,    \* TRUE: such a call with no chain is a hop (#597); FALSE: an entry
    Abandoners, \* runtimes that give up a synchronous call locally, without `cancel`
    Hidden,     \* runtimes that make synchronous calls from another thread, unmarked
    Ends,       \* TRUE: a session may end during the run
    Async,      \* TRUE: an activation may make an asynchronous call
    Workers,    \* host threads that run Rust plugin code (a bounded pool)
    Services,   \* TRUE: a runtime may call a Rust service (the host as a participant)
    Cancellers, \* runtimes that cancel a synchronous call with `cancel`
    KeepMark,   \* TRUE: a cancelled call stays marked until it ends (#561)
    KeepChain,  \* TRUE: a call made after an asynchronous suspension keeps its chain
    Linked,     \* groups of sessions sharing one pump (a Cordis node's connectors)
    Remote      \* sessions on another host: this host does not record their waits

\*  - a call that enters a stacked, non-reentrant runtime y whose stack is
\*    not empty, and is not on its chain, waits for every call that runtime
\*    is blocked in or running (it runs only once the stack is empty);
\*  - a call running at stack index i waits for every call made from an
\*    activation at index >= i, and for every incoming call running at an
\*    index > i (LIFO: it resumes only when they return);
\*  - a dispatch waits for the listener calls the host makes under it;
\*  - a host execution waits for the calls it made (its chain), and a queued
\*    one waits for whoever holds a worker;
\*  - a session's frames wait while another session of its pump group waits

\* Policy B: the graph Rust can build from what it sees itself: the hops,
\* the paths they carried, the order of ids on each session, and which
\* runtimes are reentrant or have one stack (capabilities `reentrant-sync`,
\* `sync-stack`). It cannot see a runtime's stack, but it can infer the part
\* that matters:
\*  - chain: a call waits for the calls whose path names it;
\*  - put aside: a call into a stacked, non-reentrant runtime that has calls
\*    out, none of them on its chain and none made under it, waits for all
\*    of them;
\*  - stack order (not in "Bchain"): a runtime reads its session in order
\*    and stacks what it runs, so a call c waits for every later call d
\*    into the same runtime that has started there (some call out of that
\*    runtime names d in its path). Threaded runtimes have neither edge.
\*  - entries (waits.rs): a posted call nobody waits for, recorded while
\*    some forwarded call is in progress; a boundary of chains (what is
\*    made under it is not waited for by what it was made under), and
\*    stack order holds for it like for a hop.

\* `st = "queued"`. `cancelled`/`marked` follow a `cancel`: #561 keeps the

\* records it as a hop (#597) or, in older versions, as an entry.

(***************************************************************************)
(* Properties. "No deadlock" is TLC's deadlock check: while calls are       *)
(* unfinished some step is enabled (Done covers only the finished state).   *)
(***************************************************************************)
\* A call runs as part of a waiting chain (in a runtime, or on a Rust
\* pumping thread) only if it really belongs to that chain: a callback
\* reaches the caller that is waiting for it, not one with an equal id.
RoutingSound == ~ghost.misrouted

\* A non-reentrant runtime never puts aside a call of its own chain.
ChainRecognised == ~ghost.missed

\* Policy B: SyncWaitCycle only when the waits really form a cycle.
NoFalseCycle == ~ghost.falseCycle

\* Policy A: a call is legitimate when forwarding it closes no wait cycle;
\* no legitimate call is refused.
NoLegitimateRefused == ~ghost.refusedLegit

\* Reachability checks (expected to be violated): the policy acts at all.
NeverRefused == ~ghost.refused
NeverCycle == ~ghost.cycled
\* SYN-9-3, expected to be violated: a reentrant runtime's service is
\* called in the middle of its own synchronous call.
NeverNested == ~ghost.nested
\* #561: a synchronous call received by Rust code stays marked until it
\* really ends, so a call it forwards after a cancel is still a hop.
\* `before-cancel` removes the mark at the cancel and violates this.
MarkedWhileRunning == ~ghost.unmarked
