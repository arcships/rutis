\* (CReadCancel), and one cancelled while running is dropped without an

\* A cancel for a call M was still forwarding reaches C: M passes it on, and
\* C reads it before the sessions are quiet. A cancel for a call M already
\* answered is not passed on — there is nothing left at C to cancel.

\* The relay gives the original reference back when its last grant goes:
\* while A holds none of the relay, the relay has dropped the import and C
\* holds no grant either (M1-7.1-2). The mutation that drops the relay
\* without giving the import back leaves C's export behind.
RelayReleasesImport ==
    Quiescent => (aHeld = 0 => (mImport = 0 /\ cGrants = 0))

\* A grant count travels the chain and is never counted twice: what A gave
\* back is at least what M took back, which is at least what C gave back —
\* and no hop gives back more than the one before it handed it.

\* A late reply is discarded at either hop: the cancelled call keeps the
\* outcome it got, and each call has at most one reply to discard per hop.
LateReplyDropped ==
    \A c \in Calls : (mOrphans[c] <= 1) /\ (aOrphans[c] <= 1)

\* A relayed call still settles on the caller's side: the answer comes back
\* through M.

\* The relay's own cancelled table drains: no entry waits only for a reply a
\* conforming callee never sends (#1099). The call M cancelled while C still
\* had it queued is answered by nobody, so the entry stays — the same gap as
\* on the caller's side (`CancelledEntriesDrain` in `CallLifecycle.tla`), one
\* hop further along. `relay-gap-cancel-table` finds it.
