(* Calls on one session between the two endpoints of protocol 4: A calls,  *)
(* B runs the method and replies, A may cancel before the reply arrives,   *)
(* the reply grants a reference that A releases, and either side may close *)
(* the session.                                                            *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* The model also answers the questions of #626:                           *)
(*  - What a reader thread's write-back does when its outbound channel is  *)
(*    full. `ReaderWrites = "direct"` is the shape before #1005: the       *)
(*    reader writes on the channel and blocks in `send`. `"queued"` is     *)
(*    today's: the reader hands the frame to the writer thread (an         *)
(*    unbounded queue) and goes on reading; the writer thread is the one   *)
(*    that blocks. The pre-#1005 shape deadlocks: both readers block on a  *)
(*    full channel while the only frames that would free a channel are     *)
(*    behind the other blocked reader.                                     *)
(*  - Whether a callee answers a call it cancelled while running.          *)
(*    `Replies = "always" | "never"`, both allowed (SESS-61): a call still *)
(*    queued is dropped without a reply in both.                           *)
(*  - What a locally abandoned synchronous call leaves behind. `Abandon =  *)
(*    "keep"` keeps the caller's waiter until the reply (today's sync      *)
(*    wait, which has no drop guard); `"drop"` forgets it without a        *)
(*    cancel, and the reply then is an unknown call and ends the session.  *)
(*  - Whether a reference the caller sent as an argument is given back     *)
(*    when the callee drops the call still queued: the callee's reader     *)
(*    drops the arguments, and each import they carried writes `release`   *)
(*    back (the same write-back as a `throw`). `Args` names the calls that *)
(*    carry one; `argLeaks` is the mutation where nothing is written back. *)
(*  - `PinnedTarget`: an admitted call keeps the object it names alive, so *)
(*    a release that arrives before the method runs does not fail it, and *)
(*    a release of an older grant does not take a newer one. `RefCalls`    *)
(*    names the calls that name an object; `noPin` and `releaseDropsAll`   *)
(*    are the two mutations.                                              *)
(*  - Frames still on the channel when the session closes. `AfterClose =   *)
(*    "lost"` drops them with the close; `"read"` keeps them, and both     *)
(*    sides then read them and refuse them (`receive` looks at `closed`    *)
(*    before the frame). `lateFrameActs` is the mutation that applies      *)
(*    such a reply anyway, which settles a call twice.                    *)
(*  - The host's bound on the writer queue (SESS-75): `OutboundLimit =      *)
(*    "frames"` with `Limit` ends the session instead of queueing past it, *)
(*    so a peer that stopped reading ends the session rather than growing *)
(*    the queue.                                                          *)
(*  - The caller's cancelled table and what clears it (#1099, and the      *)
(*    `BoundedTables` of #626). `CancelTable = "late"` is today's: only a  *)
(*    late reply clears an entry, and no conforming callee answers a call  *)
(*    cancelled while queued. `"ack"` adds a cancel acknowledgement frame *)
(*    (the callee must then never answer) and `"bounded"` keeps at most    *)
(*    `TableCap` entries and forgets the oldest, whose replies it then     *)
(*    discards instead of failing them (`SESS-41` relaxed); `"forget"`     *)
(*    drops the entry at once, which the late reply of a running call then *)
(*    turns into an unknown call (`call-gap-unknown-late`).               *)
(*                                                                         *)
(* Design: docs/protocol-session.md §5 (call numbers, one settlement),     *)
(* §6 (references), §7 (cancel, "the callee's reply after a cancel is not  *)
(* guaranteed"), §10 (backlog and `outbound_limit`);                       *)
(* docs/formal-trace.md §3.4 (cancel) and §3.5 (errors);                   *)
(* docs/design-formal-verification-2026-11-08.md §3.4; issue #626, #1099.  *)
(* Implementation: crates/rutis-bridge/src/session/rpc.rs —                *)
(* `Calls::admit` (a call number is taken once and only grows),            *)
(* `reply_target` (a reply takes its waiter out; the reply of a cancelled  *)

(* `Frame::Cancel` (a queued call is dropped without a reply, a running    *)
(* one still replies), `Frame::Release` (the export entry goes when its    *)
(* grants reach zero, `release of unknown reference` beyond them) and      *)

\* discarded. The session goes on.
\* The mutation applies it as if the call were still waiting: the call is
\* settled a second time and its value kept.

\* a late reply and cleans both; `drop` forgets them, so the reply is an
\* unknown call (ADeliverStray). This is the shape of a sync wait, which
\* has no drop guard (an async call's future sends `cancel` when dropped).

\* A cancel never ends the session: the close that ends it is the caller's,

CancelKeepsSession == closeCause # "cancel"

\* A conforming pair never ends a session with a reply the caller cannot
\* place (SESS-41 read as "a correct sender never produces one"). A locally
\* abandoned call (AbandonKeepsSession) and a cancelled call whose table
\* entry was dropped too early (`call-gap-unknown-late`) are the two ways to
\* break it.
NoUnknownCall == closeCause # "unknownCall"

\* The same rule where a locally abandoned call is concerned.
AbandonKeepsSession == NoUnknownCall

\* A call is settled at most once, whether by its reply, by a cancel, by a
\* local abandonment or by the session ending.
SettlesAtMostOnce == \A c \in Calls : settles[c] <= 1

\* A late reply is discarded: the cancelled (or abandoned) call keeps the

\* has at most one reply to discard.

\* session.
LateFramesInert ==
    aclosed => (settles = settlesClosed /\ aheld = aheldClosed)

\* An admitted call keeps its target: no call is dropped for want of the
\* object it names, and a release of an older grant does not take a newer
\* one — a session that ends on a release count it granted was dropped for.
PinnedTarget ==
    /\ bLost = 0
    /\ closeCause # "badRelease"

\* Every reference A granted through an argument is given back by the callee
\* when the call lets the arguments go: at rest A's table holds none of them.
ArgRefsReleased ==

\* The count A reads back is the count it gave out: the grants, the ones still
\* out and the ones given back agree while the session is open.
ArgRefsCounted ==
    ~aclosed => aArgsOut + aArgBack = aArgGiven

\* The writer queue never holds more than the host allows (SESS-75): what
\* would not fit ends the session instead (`OverLimitA`/`OverLimitB`).
BacklogBounded ==
    OutboundLimit = "none"
    \/ (Len(aout) <= Limit /\ Len(bout) <= Limit)

\* Liveness, with no close to fall back on: a call A waits for is answered
\* or cancelled, so the callee answers what it took.

\* "bounded table" option): an entry may stay until the session ends, but the
\* table cannot grow with the number of cancellations.
CancelledTableBounded ==
    Cardinality({d \in Calls : aTable[d] = "cancelled"}) <= TableCap

\* The caller's table of cancelled calls drains: no entry waits for a reply
\* to clear it. A callee that never answers a cancelled call leaves one
\* behind (the #626 gap: `call-gap-cancel-table`), whether the entry is
\* cleared by a late reply (`"late"`), by an acknowledgement (`"ack"`), or
\* dropped by the bounded table (`"bounded"`).
CancelledEntriesDrain ==
    Quiescent => \A c \in Calls : aTable[c] # "cancelled"

\* No grant is lost: at rest every unit B granted is held by A or given
\* back. A discarded late reply that did not release its reference would
\* leave a unit unaccounted (the reference-conservation rule of trace
\* contract §4).
GrantsConserved ==
    Quiescent => aheld + aReleased + aCleared = granted

\* A locally abandoned call leaves no wait-graph edge once the session is
\* quiet: the reply the callee still sends cleans it.
