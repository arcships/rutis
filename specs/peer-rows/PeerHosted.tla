(***************************************************************************)
(* The far end: loads its row, cancels it while loading, unloads it.       *)
(***************************************************************************)

\* `plugins.describe` / `rows.schema`: what this host has. A plugin it
\* does not contain is Missing (NotFound).
Describe(k) ==
    /\ session = "open"
    /\ schema' = [schema EXCEPT ![k] =
                     IF Mutation = "wrongDescribe" \/ k \in Catalog
                     THEN "found" ELSE "missing"]

    /\ UNCHANGED <<session, row, loading, loaded, tomb, orphan, loads,
                   updates, badUpdate, badLoad>>

\* `plugins.load`: the row starts loading here. A key unloaded before it
\* was loaded is refused (its tombstone is remembered); the `noTombstone`
\* mutation forgets the tombstone and loads it anyway (#625). A plugin the
\* far end did not describe as present is not loaded (`loadMissing` does).
Load(k) ==
    /\ session = "open"
    /\ row[k] = "idle"
    /\ loads[k] < MaxLoads
    /\ (Mutation = "noTombstone" \/ k \notin tomb)
    /\ (Mutation = "loadMissing" \/ schema[k] = "found")
    /\ row' = [row EXCEPT ![k] = "loading"]
    /\ loading' = loading \cup {k}
    /\ loads' = [loads EXCEPT ![k] = @ + 1]
    /\ badLoad' = (badLoad \/ schema[k] # "found")
    /\ UNCHANGED <<session, loaded, tomb, orphan, schema, described, updates,
                   badUpdate>>

\* The apply finished. A key with a tombstone (unloaded while loading) is
\* disposed at once; one whose far end cancelled it without an unload (the
\* `cancelNoUnload` mutation) stays loaded here and is the orphan.
FinishLoad(k) ==
    /\ session = "open"
    /\ k \in loading
    /\ loading' = loading \ {k}
    /\ IF k \in tomb
       THEN /\ loaded' = loaded
            /\ orphan' = orphan \ {k}
            /\ row' = IF row[k] = "loading"
                      THEN [row EXCEPT ![k] = "idle"] ELSE row
       ELSE IF row[k] # "loading"

    /\ UNCHANGED <<session, tomb, schema, described, loads, updates,
                   badUpdate, badLoad>>

\* The far end drops the row while it loads. It sends `rows.unload` (which
\* either finds the key loaded, or arrives while the apply is still out and
\* becomes a tombstone); `cancelNoUnload` is the doubt: no disposer was
\* registered, so nothing is sent.
CancelLoad(k) ==
    /\ session = "open"
    /\ row[k] = "loading"
    /\ row' = [row EXCEPT ![k] = "cancelled"]
    /\ IF Mutation = "cancelNoUnload"
       THEN UNCHANGED <<tomb, loaded, orphan>>
       ELSE IF k \in loaded
            THEN /\ loaded' = loaded \ {k}
                 /\ orphan' = orphan \ {k}
                 /\ tomb' = tomb
            ELSE /\ tomb' = tomb \cup {k}
                 /\ UNCHANGED <<loaded, orphan>>
    /\ UNCHANGED <<session, loading, schema, described, loads, updates,
                   badUpdate, badLoad>>

\* `plugins.unload`: a loaded row is disposed; one still loading gets a
\* tombstone. An unload before its load (the `noTombstone` mutation) is
\* forgotten, so the later load inserts the row: the other half of #625.
Unload(k) ==
    /\ session = "open"
    /\ row[k] \in {"loading", "loaded"}
    /\ row' = [row EXCEPT ![k] = "idle"]
    /\ IF k \in loaded
       THEN /\ loaded' = loaded \ {k}
            /\ orphan' = orphan \ {k}
            /\ tomb' = tomb
       ELSE IF k \in loading
            THEN IF Mutation = "noTombstone"
                 THEN UNCHANGED <<tomb, loaded, orphan>>
                 ELSE /\ tomb' = tomb \cup {k}
                      /\ UNCHANGED <<loaded, orphan>>
            ELSE UNCHANGED <<tomb, loaded, orphan>>
    /\ UNCHANGED <<session, loading, schema, described, loads, updates,
                   badUpdate, badLoad>>

    /\ UNCHANGED <<session, row, loading, loaded, tomb, orphan, schema,
                   described, loads, badUpdate, badLoad>>

\* The `updateLoading` mutation: an update reaches a row whose apply is
\* still out, so the config it updates is the one being built.
UpdateEarly(k) ==
    /\ Mutation = "updateLoading"
    /\ session = "open"
    /\ row[k] = "loading"
    /\ updates < MaxUpdates
    /\ updates' = updates + 1
    /\ badUpdate' = TRUE
    /\ UNCHANGED <<session, row, loading, loaded, tomb, orphan, schema,
                   described, loads, badLoad>>
