// The session's frame pump, driven by the test (#630, formal verification
// design §3.3: "Node/Bun: frame pump, synchronous wait, re-entrancy, event
// delivery and cancellation").
//
// `Session` takes its transport as a seam: `send` for frames out, `pump` for
// frames the synchronous wait of a call reads, `receive` for the frames the
// far end sends. So pause, lateness, cancel and close are decided here, never
// by how fast the machine is: no test below waits on a timer, and a pump asked
// past its script throws instead of spinning the thread.
//
// The Node runtime's copy of this file is node/rutis-runtime/test/frame-pump.test.mjs.
// What neither covers: the process's own pump (the worker in src/client.ts) and
// the runner around it (runner.ts is a script, not a factory), so the
// runner-level frame pump has no test yet — it is the gap #630 names for Node
// and Bun ("runner.mjs 要先改成工厂"). Bun's Session has no `holds` seam, so
// the emit that arrives behind a held one (events §5.5) is not tested here;
// that is the "Bun 的过滤器在同步调用里泵帧" gap the issue names.
