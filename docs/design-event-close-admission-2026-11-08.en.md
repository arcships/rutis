# Event listener close admission without an ancestor walk

[中文](design-event-close-admission-2026-11-08.md)

Status: core implemented, verification in progress. Date: 2026-11-08; 2026-11-09 implemented the marker publication, `Entry::live`, deterministic race tests and the shuttle model.
Issue: [#1025](https://github.com/arcships/rutis/issues/1025). Implementation issues: #1025-core, #1025-tests, and #1025-benchmark (to be filed under the 0.22 plan).

## 1. Where things stand / what to solve

Every selected event listener currently asks whether its owner is open by reading the owner's state and then `Ctx::registration_open()`. The latter reads global closure and walks every ancestor (`crates/rutis/src/ctx.rs:191-207`); `Entry::live()` does this in `crates/rutis/src/bus/table.rs:77-90`. On the `close_cpu` workload (1,000 instances, 8 rows per instance, and 8,000 listeners total), the 2026-11-02 release sample spent about 38.2s creating instances; the registration-open walk was about 9.7s (about 25.4%) and each listener call loaded two or three cold ancestor cache lines. Issue #1025's target is ≤30s creation on this workload; acceptance must also meet the existing CREATE_RATIO, CLOSE_RATIO and IDLE_SHARE thresholds without changing event or shutdown semantics. The 38.2s/9.7s figures are historical issue measurements, not an automated wall-clock assertion.

The benchmark measures process CPU time (`CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID`), not wall-clock time (`crates/rutis-loader/tests/close_cpu.rs:96-106`). `CREATE_RATIO` and `CLOSE_RATIO` are respectively `CPU_time(large workload) / CPU_time(small workload)` for the create and close phases; `IDLE_SHARE` is `idle process CPU time / idle wall-clock window` (`crates/rutis-loader/tests/close_cpu.rs:198-203,273-305`). Release uses 100 and 1,000 instances, debug uses 40 and 400; the current thresholds are release `300`, `200`, `0.05`, and debug `180`, `160` (the idle threshold is shared; constants are at `crates/rutis-loader/tests/close_cpu.rs:67-79,93-94`).

Shutdown already holds `Shared.admission` while it marks a subtree and starts shutdown (`crates/rutis/src/fiber.rs:1756-1780`); root shutdown holds it while setting `Shared.closing` (`crates/rutis/src/ctx.rs:1318-1338`). Event snapshot/selection does not hold that mutex, and `Entry::start()` deliberately begins a call flight before its final liveness check. A marker added without a publication protocol could let an ancestor be closed while a descendant still appears live. The publication and detach requirements below are proposed and unverified until the implementation and race tests establish that proof.

## 2. Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why; what is dropped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Add permanent `FiberInner::lineage_closed: AtomicBool`. It is true for a permanently closed fiber and every member of a subtree at its shutdown commit; it is initialized true for fibers created after the root is closed and is never reset by a generation reload. | A per-entry marker and an inherited shared marker are dropped: entries are dynamic, and a shared marker would close siblings when only one subtree closes. |
| D2 | Publish markers in a two-phase shutdown pass under `Shared.admission`: collect the fixed subtree; store `lineage_closed=true` for every member in postorder (leaf to root); only after all stores, publish the existing per-fiber `closing=true` flags and (for root) `Shared.closing=true`; then enqueue cleanup. The shutdown linearization point is the completion of the marker pass, not the first ancestor flag. The implementation must either keep child-link detach under this lock or prove that a detaching fiber can no longer admit work. | A naive ancestor-to-child flag propagation is dropped because it creates an ancestor-closed/child-live window. A postorder-only public closing change is dropped because it moves the existing close boundary. |
| D3 | `Entry::live()` reads `withdrawn`, owner upgrade, `alive`, `owner.closing`, `owner.lineage_closed`, and `live_generation`; it no longer walks the context parent chain. `Entry::start()` keeps `CallFlight::begin(owner)` followed by the final `live()` check. | Removing the final check or the event flight is dropped: admitted calls must still drain; no call may be admitted after the marker commit, while an already admitted call may begin after the commit and finish under the existing rules. |
| D4 | Keep `Ctx::registration_open()` and its ancestor walk for registration/service APIs. This optimization changes only listener liveness, not public registration errors or instance-event admission. | Replacing all lifecycle checks with the listener marker is dropped because registration has a separate API contract. |
| D5 | Use `SeqCst` in the first implementation. No event snapshot lock or blocking admission lock is added to the hot path. The two-phase marker stores give the event path a stable commit boundary; `Entry::start` rejects new admission if it observes the marker after commit. | Holding `Shared.admission` while every dispatch selects a table would add a lock to every emit and risks missing the CPU target. A new memory-order proof is deferred. |

## 3. Rules

**Status of these rules.** On 2026-11-09 the core of rules 1, 2 and 5 landed: the two-phase `mark_subtree_lineage` / `publish_subtree_closing` publication, `release_transient` detaching under the lock, root-subtree marking, `Entry::live` reading only the owner marker, and the `CallFlight` order in `Entry::start`. The deterministic tests are in `crates/rutis-loader/tests/event_close_admission.rs`; the shuttle model is in `crates/rutis/src/fiber/shuttle_tests.rs`. Loading-owner, `once`, remote-entry, cross-process and reload coverage for rules 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 is not complete, so no rule in this section is called a current guarantee yet.

1. **Proposed, unverified.** Before a non-root subtree closes, its shutdown path must hold `Shared.admission`, collect every currently attached descendant, and store `lineage_closed=true` in postorder (leaf to root). It must then store each existing `closing=true` and call `pre_cancel`, and only then call `begin_subtree_shutdown_locked`. Fiber creation and subtree collection use `Shared.admission`; `release_transient` now removes a child from `parent.children` under the same lock (`crates/rutis/src/fiber.rs:1477-1500`). Tests: `crates/rutis-loader/tests/event_close_admission.rs`; model: `crates/rutis/src/fiber/shuttle_tests.rs`. Implementation: `mark_subtree_lineage` / `publish_subtree_closing` (`crates/rutis/src/fiber.rs:2172-2226`).
2. **Proposed, unverified.** Root shutdown performs the same root-plus-descendants marker pass, then stores `Shared.closing=true`, pre-cancels root/descendants and posts the existing shutdown intent. Root descendants must be marked even though old root shutdown used only `Shared.closing`.
3. **Proposed, unverified.** A fiber created while the shared root is already closing starts disposed with `lineage_closed=true`. A permanently closed marker is never cleared during restart/update; a new fiber receives a new marker.
4. **Proposed, unverified.** The marker pass is the closure admission boundary: calls whose final `Entry::live` marker load occurs before completion may be admitted and are waited on normally; a check after completion admits no new call. A selected entry may be stale; `Entry::start` is the authoritative final check. The two required interleavings are: (a) `Entry::start` completes its final `live()` before marker-pass completion, so the call is admitted and must drain; (b) the marker pass completes before the final `live()`, so `CallFlight` is dropped and no listener runs. An already admitted callback may begin after its owner's marker commit but must drain under the existing rules; no new callback is admitted after the commit. Because this commit point is later than the first `closing` store in the current implementation, the implementation test must also record whether the admission window changes during the pass.
5. **Proposed, unverified.** `Entry::start` begins `CallFlight` before `live`; a closed result immediately drops the flight and calls no listener. Accepted calls retain the existing `event_flights` wait and cancellation behaviour. `once` is claimed only after `start`, so a skipped listener is not consumed.
6. **Proposed, unverified.** The marker is permanent for a subtree shutdown. An ordinary generation unload/reload keeps the fiber available to future generations only when it has not been permanently shut down; `lineage_closed` is not reset by reload. `withdrawn`, `alive`, `closing` and `live_generation` retain their existing meanings.
7. **Proposed, unverified.** Registration still takes the existing admission lock and repeats its lifecycle check at commit. A preflight that reads open while the marker pass runs cannot commit through the lock; no new registration is admitted into the closing subtree.
8. Existing instance-event rules remain unchanged. Registration/effect/provide-style admission after closure returns `ErrorKind::Closed` (`root has been shut down`), as covered by `crates/rutis/tests/instance_subtrees.rs:291-325`. The proposed listener rule is that `Ctx::emit()` itself does not fail merely because the subtree is closed and reaches no live listener there; this is not yet a current guarantee: `Filtered::emit()` is a synchronous `Result<(), Error>` API (`crates/rutis/src/events/api.rs:453-480`), while the existing service-after-stop test explicitly leaves post-stop delivery unspecified (`crates/rutis/tests/service_emits.rs:70-83`). The implementation tests must pin the proposed result for `emit`, `serial`, `parallel`, `bail` and waterfall. This optimization concerns non-instance listener `Entry::live`; it does not alter instance-event admission.
9. **Proposed, unverified.** The listener callback, event order, dispatch modes, cross-process protocol, cancellation deadline, and shutdown output do not change. A separate process or runtime sees no new message.
10. **Proposed, unverified.** If implementation uses a retrying sequence guard rather than only the two-phase marker, it must keep the same rule: an event path may not return a live result from a mixed publication. It may use a `shutdown_sequence` odd/even guard with `SeqCst`, but must benchmark spin cost and prove no unbounded wait. The default implementation is the marker-first two-phase pass.

## 4. What developers see

### Plugin authors

Target behavior after (and only after) the proposed implementation is verified: there is no API or output change. A listener registered by a running row receives exactly the same events and errors. When its ancestor is permanently shut down, an event emitted after the marker commit does not call it; `effect()`, `provide()` and listener-registration attempts after closure still return `ErrorKind::Closed`, with the text `root has been shut down` and no new `code`/`data`. The proposed `emit()` behavior is to return normally while reaching no live listener there; that delivery result remains unverified until the race tests land. In-flight callbacks finish or are cancelled by the existing shutdown deadline.

Concepts added: none. `lineage_closed` is an internal performance marker.

### People assembling plugins with `rutis-host`

There is no configuration change and no new status line. `rutis-host status` continues to print the existing row states (`running`, `stopping`, `stopped`, or the existing failure headline). The event-close optimization has no host error code or migration setting.

Concepts added: none.

### Host owners embedding rutis

The proposal targets no change to public Rust APIs, the event protocol or shutdown results; this target is not a current guarantee until the marker implementation and race tests pass. The current baseline already has the admission and drain rules exercised by the existing event tests. Under the proposal, after subtree admission closes no new listener callback is admitted; an already admitted call may begin after the commit but drains according to the existing wait/cancel rules. There is no proposed new error code or data field.

Concepts added: none; maintainers gain only an internal owner marker and a closure linearization rule.

### People deploying

No deployment setting, wire version or process boundary changes. The release artifact behaves as before, with lower instance-creation CPU in the stress benchmark. There is no visible success or error output change.

Concepts added: none.

## 5. Compatibility and migration

- The proposal targets no change to the public API, event protocol, listener ordering, shutdown state/output or error codes; these are not new current guarantees.
- Existing listener code is expected to need no migration if the proposal is implemented. The proposed compatibility requirement is that post-closure events remain excluded and admitted calls still drain; this remains unverified.
- `close_cpu` remains a release benchmark. Compare creation CPU and close CPU against the existing `CREATE_RATIO=300`, `CLOSE_RATIO=200`, `IDLE_SHARE=5%` thresholds; do not trade away close semantics to improve creation.
- No package-version or runtime protocol field is proposed by this internal change. The 0.22 release notes may mention the performance fix only after the event shutdown guarantee is re-verified.

## 6. Implementation

1. **Core marker and publication (#1025-core).** Add `lineage_closed` to `FiberInner`, initialize it from the initial closed state, centralize non-root and root shutdown marker publication under `Shared.admission`, mark the fixed subtree before existing `closing`/`Shared.closing` publication, and keep cleanup ordering unchanged. Remove `owner.ctx.registration_open()` only from `Entry::live`. Proposed completion gate: source-level lock/order review proves all subtree members are marked before the close boundary; generation reload never clears the marker.
2. **Event race tests (#1025-tests).** Add a deterministic parent→child listener test: complete parent shutdown's marker pass, immediately emit from an unaffected context, and assert zero child calls; add root shutdown, nested subtree, sibling, Loading-owner, repeated-shutdown and remote-entry coverage. Use the testing selection hook to select an entry, shut down before `Entry::start`, and assert the marker final check skips it; verify an accepted in-flight callback still drains. Proposed completion gate: no new callback is admitted after commit in sync, `emit`, `serial`, `parallel`, `bail` and waterfall paths; an admitted callback may begin after commit but drains under the existing rules.
3. **Benchmark and CI (#1025-benchmark).** Run `cargo test -p rutis-loader --release --test close_cpu -- --nocapture`; compare creation and close CPU and queued-emits memory. The acceptance job is the Ubuntu 24.04 release job in `.github/workflows/stress.yml:381-417`, which runs `close_cpu` and then `queued_emits_memory`; its summary must retain both results. Update the 0.22 performance record/CI summary only with measured values. Proposed completion gate: record the issue workload's ≤30s creation-time target; the automated test continues to compare the existing `CREATE_RATIO`, `CLOSE_RATIO` and `IDLE_SHARE` thresholds, with no close-CPU regression and the queued-emits memory result retained.
4. **Docs/release (#1025-docs).** Keep this document and its Chinese counterpart synchronized; add the 0.22 release-note line and link the unchanged event shutdown guarantee. Proposed completion gate: bilingual review confirms no new developer-visible behavior is implied.

### Progress, 2026-11-09

- **Core:** `FiberInner::lineage_closed` is initialized from the initial closed state; non-root and root shutdown both collect the fixed subtree under `Shared.admission`, store every marker, then publish `closing` / `Shared.closing`; `release_transient` detaches under the same lock.
- **Tests:** `cargo test -p rutis-loader --test event_close_admission` passes 4 cases: all five dispatch modes skip after commit, root skips, nested/sibling, and an admitted callback drains.
- **Model:** `shuttle_lineage_marker_precedes_closing` passes; moving `publish_subtree_closing` before `mark_subtree_lineage` makes the model report "this node is closing while its lineage marker is clear".
- **Model:** all seven `specs/event-close/run.sh` configurations end as `expected.txt` says: `close-healthy` 2,263,040 distinct states in 21 s, `close-tree` 688,580 in 12 s, `close-drain` 31,488 in 1 s; the four mutations violate `ClosingImpliesMarked`, `CommittedStaysOut` (twice) and `CleanupOnce`.
- **Benchmark (local release, Linux x86-64):** 100 instances: create 150.60 ms, close 119.06 ms; 1000 instances: create 16.94 s, close 11.33 s. `CREATE_RATIO`, `CLOSE_RATIO` and `IDLE_SHARE` all pass; the issue's ≤30s creation target is met on this machine. The CI `stress.yml` `cpu` job still needs to record the same numbers.
- **Still missing:** focused Loading-owner, `once` and remote-entry cases; the CI stress job; release notes. Rules stay proposed until those land.

## 7. Design-philosophy check

The optimization is implemented once in the Rust core, opens no broad hook, pins the closure boundary and memory ordering in tests, and makes no cross-process promise beyond the existing contract. The only behavior that cannot be made faster without risk—the exact shutdown admission boundary—is stated as a rule rather than silently changed. This follows design-philosophy §7 principles 1, 3, 4, 7 and 10.
