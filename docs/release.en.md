# Releases

## Release train

Except for `rutis-cli` (`cli-v*`, `release-cli.yml`), these packages share a version and are released together (from 0.8.0, the core and the dylib toolchain included):

| Registry | Packages |
| --- | --- |
| crates.io | `rutis` (the core), `rutis-bridge`, `rutis-loader`, `rutis-host`; the dylib toolchain `rutis-sdk`, `rutis-dylib`, `rutis-dylib-meta`, `rutis-dylib-launcher` |
| npm | `@arcships/rutis`, `@arcships/rutis-runtime`, `@arcships/rutis-host` and `@arcships/rutis-host-{linux,darwin}-{x64,arm64}`, `@arcships/rutis-host-win32-x64` |
| PyPI | `rutis`, `rutis-host` (wheels for each platform) |
| GitHub Release | `rutis-host` binaries |

## Steps

1. Update versions in the Cargo.toml of every crate listed in `crates` in `scripts/train.mjs` (including the dependency versions between them and from other workspace crates); `node/rutis`, `node/rutis-runtime`, and `node/rutis-host` package.json files (including the runtime and platform package versions used by `@arcships/rutis-host`); `python/rutis/pyproject.toml` and `IMPLEMENTATION` in `python/rutis/rutis/peer.py`; and the `rutis` range in `crates/rutis-host/pyproject.toml`. `node scripts/train.mjs` checks that they match, and CI runs it too.
2. Merge to `main` and confirm the CI `release-dry-run` passes (all packages can be built).
3. Run the smoke test on two machines before publishing (see below).
4. Create and push a tag such as `vX.Y.Z`. `release.yml` checks versions, builds binaries and wheels for five platforms, semver-checks the crates already on crates.io, publishes the crates in dependency order (`node scripts/train.mjs --crates`), then the npm and PyPI packages, and creates a GitHub Release (its notes come from `docs/releases/X.Y.Z.en.md`, which must exist before tagging). Each step skips versions already present in its registry, so after fixing a mid-release failure you can rerun it.

Required configuration: GitHub environment `release` with `CARGO_TOKEN` and `NPM_TOKEN`, and environments `pypi` and `pypi-host`. On PyPI, the trusted publisher of `rutis` points to `release.yml` with environment `pypi`, and that of `rutis-host` to environment `pypi-host`: the two must differ, or a release gets a token valid for only one of them.

Increment `PLUGIN_API` (present in both the SDK and runtime) only when the interface visible to plugins becomes incompatible. Increment the session protocol version (`rutisProtocol` and `rutis_bridge::session::PROTOCOL`) when the wire format becomes incompatible.

## Smoke test

```text
# Listener (the certificate must match its hostname)
cargo run -p rutis-bridge --features websocket --example smoke -- \
    listen 0.0.0.0:7443 --cert server.pem --key server.key --token secret

# Dialer
cargo run -p rutis-bridge --features websocket --example smoke -- \
    dial wss://<listener-hostname>:7443/rutis --ca ca.pem --token secret
```

Expected behavior: the dialer prints `clock: <n>` every second. After a network outage, both sides report a heartbeat timeout and wait to reconnect within 30 seconds; after recovery, they report `ready, session <n+1>`. Restarting the listener makes the dialer retry with backoff. A wrong token returns `AuthRejected … 403`; an untrusted CA returns `AuthRejected … UnknownIssuer`.

Then use the published packages to follow [Write a TypeScript plugin](guide/typescript-plugin.en.md) and [Write a Python plugin](guide/python-plugin.en.md) from a clean environment.

The nightly stress workflow also runs two soak tests (repeated link disconnect/reconnect and repeated process start/exit) and checks that file descriptor and thread counts do not grow and all processes are reaped.

## 0.8.0

From this release the core and the dylib toolchain are in the train: push only `v0.8.0`; the `rutis-v*` tags and publish-rutis.yml are retired. `rutis-sdk`, `rutis-dylib`, `rutis-dylib-meta` and `rutis-dylib-launcher` are published to crates.io for the first time.

## 0.7.0

0.7.0 is the train's first release and builds on core 0.6.1: push only `v0.7.0`, no `rutis-v*`. Apart from `rutis-loader` (0.1.0 before), every package is a new name on its registry: configure pending publishers for `rutis` and `rutis-host` on PyPI first. After the release succeeds, withdraw the old `rutis-interop` from crates.io and npm.
