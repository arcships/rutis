# Rule trace table

[中文](README.md) · [Session trace contract](../formal-trace.en.md) · [Guarantee register](../guarantees.en.md) · [Quality standard](../quality-standard.md)

Status: first version, partial coverage. Date: 2026-11-11. Baseline: `origin/main` `449ed13a`.
Issue: [#634](https://github.com/arcships/rutis/issues/634) (the 0.21 trace table, [#776](https://github.com/arcships/rutis/issues/776)); plan: [0.22 plan](../plan/formal-verification-0.22.md) WS3; fields and status rules: §5 of the [formal verification design](../design-formal-verification-2026-11-08.md).

2026-11-11: the 1368 protocol rules were re-checked against the current 0.22 sources; the result is in the [re-check page](recheck-0.22.md) (Chinese). A protocol row's status now comes from that re-check, not from the issue snapshot.

2026-11-11 (semantic re-extraction, baseline `4a1ac08b`): the 44 rows of the session trace contract (`TRC-*`) were rewritten against their current sources; 43 rows name `SESS-*` anchors, and `TRC-INV-7` says the session specification does not cover trace output. The Chinese table is §5 of the [re-check page](recheck-0.22.md), the English per-row text is the [English re-check page](recheck-0.22.en.md). No status moved (the re-extraction added no implementation evidence). The other partitions are still not re-extracted.

2026-11-09: WS1 landed the core of #1025 (marker publication, `Entry::live`, deterministic race tests, a shuttle model), which lifts blockers G3 and G4 of plan §3; the `ECA-*` rows with implementation or tests became seven `部分验证` rows, the rest stay `未验证`.

Each row is one rule rutis promises, with its current source, the plain-language promise, the level, the implementations it applies to, the evidence (a path, a test name or a line range), a mutation or counterexample, the status and the gap. Status follows §3 of the [guarantee register](../guarantees.en.md). Numbers and evidence checks come from the script:

```sh
node tools/formal-trace.mjs            # status counts, then the checks
node tools/formal-trace.mjs --write    # regenerate the guarantee rows, refresh the index
node tools/formal-trace.mjs --check    # the checks only
```

## 1. What this version covers, and what it does not

In the table:

- **All 211 rows of the guarantee register**: 200 current, 8 withdrawn, 3 duplicate numbers that are not counted on their own (`core/D20`, `core/D26`, `core/D27`). The script extracts them from the register's Markdown tables; id, level, status and evidence are copied, never remembered. The script counts the table's rows; §16 of the register still disagrees (see §5).
- **The nine categories of the [session trace contract](../formal-trace.en.md)** (success, failure and boundary of each), its 8 trace invariants and its 9 explicit non-guarantees: 44 rows, ids `TRC-*`.
- **The 10 proposed rules in §3 of the [event-close admission design](../design-event-close-admission-2026-11-08.en.md)**: ids `ECA-*`; seven have implementation, deterministic tests or a shuttle model and are `部分验证`, three stay `未验证`.
- **The 1368 rules of #634**: six files, 1552 rows (1368 current + 184 replaced), in `rules/protocol-*.md`. Each file is one section comment's Markdown table exported verbatim (the two session comments make one file); the columns are still the issue's ten. The script maps the issue's status at read time (§3). Rows per section:

  | File | Section | Current | Replaced | Rows |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | [protocol-registry-1.md](rules/protocol-registry-1.md) | `registry-1` | 156 | 9 | 165 |
  | [protocol-registry-2.md](rules/protocol-registry-2.md) | `registry-2` | 218 | 0 | 218 |
  | [protocol-events.md](rules/protocol-events.md) | `events` | 253 | 9 | 262 |
  | [protocol-session.md](rules/protocol-session.md) | `session` parts 1–2 | 246 | 104 | 350 |
  | [protocol-runtime.md](rules/protocol-runtime.md) | `runtime` | 264 | 45 | 309 |
  | [protocol-remote.md](rules/protocol-remote.md) | `remote` | 231 | 17 | 248 |
  | Total | — | 1368 | 184 | 1552 |

- **The TRC partition (44 rows) is re-extracted semantically** (2026-11-11, baseline `4a1ac08b`): the nine trace categories, the 8 invariants and the 9 explicit non-guarantees in `rules/trace-contract.md` were rewritten row by row against `docs/formal-trace.md`, §11 of `docs/protocol-session.md` and `docs/design-remote-session-2026-10-28.md`. 43 rows name `SESS-*` anchors; `TRC-INV-7` has none and says the session specification does not specify trace output. `--check` verifies the source sections, the anchors, the statuses and the English page. **The other partitions are not re-extracted**: the 1552 protocol rows keep the issue's wording, the 211 register rows are generated from the register, and the 10 `ECA` rows are design proposals. The re-extraction data is this partition only (`tools/formal-trace-semantic.mjs`).
- **Status of the 1368 after the 0.22 re-check** ([re-check page](recheck-0.22.md), Chinese): 111 `已验证`, 376 `部分验证`, 540 `未验证`, 42 `明确不保证`, 201 `不单独计数`, and 98 rows withdrawn because 0.19 or 0.22 removed the mechanism they describe. The issue snapshot's 184 `已取代` rows were not re-checked. 1368 = 111 + 376 + 540 + 42 + 201 + 98.

**Re-check method.** Four checks per rule: the source still exists (and 0.19 / 0.22 did not remove what it describes), a current anchor (a `SESS-*` id from `docs/protocol-session.md`; 161 rows have one), the named evidence resolves, and a status that only moves down. 261 rows have no current source — the multi-language runtimes design of 0.9, the remote-plugins design, register rows the register dropped — and are listed by reason in the re-check page §5. The specification's `当前` is not this table's `已验证`. Register rows the register withdrew follow the register. Protocol row text was not rewritten: semantic re-extraction covers the `TRC` partition (44 rows) only.

- All 1368 come from the 2026-10 snapshot (`main` `3496669b`); the re-check maps their sources and evidence, it does not re-derive the wording from the 0.22 specifications. #634 itself says the 11 design documents of 0.17–0.19 and the new #635 specification must be re-extracted (plan §3 G2). WS2's `docs/protocol-session.md` (82 `SESS-*` numbers) is the only current specification for the session layer; the event protocol is the current source for events but was not updated for 0.19 (its `events-v2` and node export/import rules are withdrawn).
- The snapshot mapping sets the ceiling. Of the 137 `已覆盖` rows only 116 were `已验证` under it: 4 are TLA-only, 6 are model-only, 10 have no named evidence, and 1 (`events/one-bus b`) names files that no longer exist. The 977 `部分`/`未覆盖`/`未登记` rows stay at `部分验证`/`未验证`.
- 6 of the 555 `未覆盖` rows are explicit non-guarantees in their rule text (`SYN-9-3`, `SYN-9-26`, `SYN-9-32`, `MNT-2-12`, `MNT-4.2-3`, `MNT-10-4`) and become `明确不保证`; the other 549 are `未验证`.
- Of the 249 `不适用` rows, 35 say "明确不保证" in their note and become `明确不保证`; the others are `不单独计数` (tests only, formalization cannot reach them) and are not counted as unverified.
- **80 protocol ids also exist in the guarantee register** (for example `core/D1`, `bridge/value-roundtrip`); the protocol list is finer-grained in places (`core/D2a`/`D2b`). Both rows are kept. **1817 is a row count, not a count of distinct rules**; do not add the register and protocol subtotals.
- Behaviour in design and user documents that is in neither the register nor the #634 list (other than Q3.3 implementation details) has not been extracted.

So the release gate (design §5, quality standard Q13.1) **cannot** be judged from this table: 261 protocol rules have no current source, 201 rows are not counted, and 10 bare file names in the evidence column do not resolve (7 rows, §5).

## 2. Numbering

| Form | Source | Example | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<family>/<name>` | guarantee register | `core/D6`, `bridge/in-flight-call-fails-once` | kept as the register writes it; never rewritten or reused; withdrawn rows stay |
| `<family>/<name>`, suffix `a`–`g` | #634 `registry-1`/`registry-2` | `core/D2a`, `bridge/value-tags e` | kept as the issue writes it; the suffix splits one guarantee into separately verifiable requirements, it is not a new number |
| `<prefix>-<section>-<number>` | #634 `events`, `session`, `runtime`, `remote` | `EVP-2.1-1`, `SES-6.1-12`, `VAL-1-V10`, `TAG-3-R1` | prefixes `EVP`, `EVD`, `SES`, `VAL`, `TAG`, `M1`, `CHN`, `SYN`, `M2`, `MNT`, `REQ`, `RTP`, `INS`, `MSV`, `REM`, `DIA`, `APP`, `NOD`; sections may carry dots (`6.1`), numbers may carry letters (`9a`, `V10`, `R1`) |
| `TRC-<category>-<n>` | session trace contract §3 | `TRC-GREET-2` | categories `LIFE`, `FRAME`, `GREET`, `REF`, `CANCEL`, `ERR`, `LIMIT`, `MALFORMED`, `NET`; `1` success, `2` failure, `3` boundary |
| `TRC-INV-<n>` | session trace contract §4 | `TRC-INV-2` | the eight trace invariants |
| `TRC-NG-<n>` | session trace contract §1, "not guaranteed" | `TRC-NG-4` | explicit non-guarantees |
| `ECA-<n>` | event-close admission design §3 | `ECA-4` | the design's own rule numbers |

Numbers are only added, never changed: moving a row to another section, renaming it or moving it to another file keeps its number; a deleted row stays with a status and a reason.

## 3. Fields and status

| Field | Meaning | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | see §2 | script (register rows), hand (trace rows), issue (protocol rows) |
| current source | the specification, design or user document and section in force; register rows name `guarantees.md §<section>` plus the register's own source column | script |
| plain-language promise | what a user observes: success, failure, scope and recovery; register rows use the register's content column verbatim | script / hand |
| level | core commitment, contractual behaviour, explicit non-guarantee (quality standard §3) | script / hand |
| scope | the implementations (Rust, Node, Bun, Python, Go, Swift, Kotlin), transport and platform | **to fill**: the register does not record it, so all 211 register rows say `未登记`; trace rows say what the document says; protocol rows carry the issue's **participants** (`跨进程`, `进程内并发`, `纯逻辑`, `外部`), not an implementation matrix |
| evidence | model, test, trace, property/fuzz, black-box or timing evidence, as a path, test name or line range | script (register's verification column verbatim) / hand; protocol rows use the issue's `现有形式化` column |
| mutation or counterexample | a bug the verification caught, or an injected error | **to fill**: register rows say `未登记`; protocol rows say `未登记` (the issue has no such column); the mutations §4 of the trace contract describes are on their rows |
| status | `已验证`, `部分验证`, `未验证`, `明确不保证`; `已撤回` and `不单独计数` are not counted | script (register rows; protocol rows from the [re-check](recheck-0.22.md)) / hand |
| gap | the next issue; an uncovered rule is never written as passing | register rows start from the register's notes column; protocol rows combine the issue, the note and the reason a `已覆盖` row was downgraded |

Explicit non-guarantees follow the register's convention (as `core/D15` does): level and status are both `明确不保证`, and they are not counted as unverified. The 9 rows from §1 of the trace contract are registered this way, and so is `TRC-GREET-3`, because no implementation has an entry point for required capabilities (#1111). A model passing marks only the model; a rule is `已验证` only with implementation evidence. A trace row is `部分验证` only when a named test asserts a point of it; source code or comments alone leave it `未验证`.

**Protocol rows (`rules/protocol-*.md`).** The files keep the issue's ten columns and status words; the script maps them to the nine columns at read time, downwards only:

| Issue status | Table status | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 已覆盖 | 已验证 / 部分验证 | `已验证` only when `手段` names an implementation check (`K`, `PT`, `FZ`, `TV`, `SH`, `KANI`, `测试`), `现有形式化` names something, and every file it names resolves in the current tree. TLA/model-only, no named evidence, or a missing file is `部分验证` |
| 部分 | 部分验证 | never raised because the issue says "partial" |
| 未覆盖 | 未验证 / 明确不保证 | the 6 rules whose text itself says "明确不保证" become `明确不保证`; the rest are `未验证` |
| 不适用 | 明确不保证 / 不单独计数 | the 35 whose note says "明确不保证" become `明确不保证`; the other 214 are tests only, formalization cannot reach them, and become `不单独计数` with the reason in the gap |
| 明确不保证 | 明确不保证 | level and status agree |
| 未登记 | 未验证 | the gap says "未登记（测试里用了、登记表没有）" |
| 已取代 | 已撤回 | the row is kept, not counted |

Nine-column alignment: id=`编号`; current source=`来源`; promise=`规则`; level=`明确不保证` or `契约行为` (the issue has no level column, so nothing is claimed as a core commitment); scope=`参与方`; evidence=`现有形式化`; mutation=`未登记`; status=the mapping above, then the re-check; gap=`归属 issue` + `备注` + the downgrade reason. The `对应` column stays in the protocol file as the cross-reference to a guarantee-register id and is not one of the nine.

**Re-check layer (2026-11-11).** The issue mapping is the ceiling, not the final status. Every protocol row also passes the four checks of the [re-check page](recheck-0.22.md) §1: the source still exists, a current anchor (a `SESS-*` id) where the session specification covers it, the named evidence resolves, and the register did not withdraw the row. It only moves down: mechanisms 0.19 / 0.22 removed (compat, `events-v2`, `sync-wait`, node `export` / `import`, `Registration`, the access point, `Revocations`, `PeerRows`, `peer:` rows, `runtimes.remote`, `Transport`, `ChannelInfo`) and rows the register withdrew become `已撤回`; a row whose current source is a historical design and has no current anchor is no longer `已验证`. Row text is not rewritten; `rules/protocol-*.md` keeps the issue's ten columns verbatim.

**Language.** The register-driven rows are generated from the Chinese register; the hand-written columns are Chinese only. The `TRC` rows have an English per-row re-extraction in [recheck-0.22.en.md](recheck-0.22.en.md). The English register (`docs/guarantees.en.md`) carries the same ids, so the rows line up; the English rows of the protocol partitions are still a gap (#634). Counts are printed by the script and kept in [the Chinese README](README.md) §4: 1817 rows, 211 register, 54 hand-written, 1552 protocol. The "264 rows" in plan §1/§5 is the count before the protocol list went in; the script output is authoritative.

## 4. Maintenance

- **After changing the register or adding a test**: `node tools/formal-trace.mjs --write`, then `--check`. `--write` rewrites the automatic columns, keeps the manual ones by id, refreshes the index and the re-check page; it does not touch `rules/protocol-*.md`.
- **Changing the protocol list**: export the table from the matching #634 comment again, keeping the ten columns, ids and notes; do not hand-edit the status in the export. `--check` verifies the ten columns, the id form, the per-section totals (156/9, 218/0, 253/9, 246/104, 264/45, 231/17; 1368/184 in total), the issue status vocabulary, duplicate ids and evidence paths.
- **Changing a current source or a re-check verdict**: edit `SOURCES`, `ANCHORS`, `SUPERSEDED` or `UNMAPPED` in `tools/formal-trace-recheck.mjs`, then `--write`. `--check` verifies the anchors exist in `docs/protocol-session.md`, the superseded ids are protocol rows, each `by` file exists, and the page matches the generator.
- **Changing a re-extracted `TRC` row**: change `rules/trace-contract.md` and the entry with the same id in `tools/formal-trace-semantic.mjs` (English rule, English gap, source section, anchors), then `--write`. `--check` verifies that the ids match one to one, that every anchor is in `docs/protocol-session.md` and named in the row's 现行来源, that every source section exists in its document, that a row without anchors gives a reason, and that the Chinese §5 table and the English page are generated. The data has one owner per file: `formal-trace-recheck.mjs` (sources, anchor ranges, withdrawn rules, no-source reasons, notes, register families), `formal-trace-semantic.mjs` (the semantic re-extraction), and `formal-trace.mjs` (columns, status words, file list). Step 0 of `--check` verifies the literals that must agree (family list, prefix list, the existence of every `SOURCES` document).
- **Adding a `TRC`/`ECA` row**: write it in `rules/` with the same columns; `--check` verifies the id form, the status vocabulary and the evidence paths.
- **Moving a row**: keep the id; change the source and the index.
- **CI**: not wired yet (WS8). Until then the two commands are run by hand.
- **English rows**: a gap (#634), see above.

## 5. Gaps found by this version

1. **The 1368 protocol rules have no current specification outside the session layer.** 261 of them have no current source: `docs/protocol-session.md` covers 161 (82 `SESS-*`), the event protocol is the current source for events but was not updated for 0.19 (its `events-v2` and node export/import rules are withdrawn), and the runtime, mount and remote partitions still point at 0.17–0.19 designs or the user guide. The multi-language runtimes design (`SYN`) and the remote-plugins design (`REM`) are historical; the re-check page §5 lists those rules by reason. Writing the specifications is #635's follow-up. The re-check maps sources, anchors, evidence and status; it does not rewrite the rule text.
2. **10 bare file names do not resolve in the current tree** (7 names, 7 rows, all in the protocol `现有形式化` column): `events-conformance.test.mjs`, `test_events_conformance.py`, `events-conformance.test.ts`, `node_conformance.rs`, `websocket_conformance.rs`, `leases.rs` (3 rows), `memory_mux.rs` (2 rows). Those rows are only `部分验证` or `未验证`; they can move up after a current path or test is supplied. The note column also has paths that no longer exist (spot-checked: `crates/rutis-bridge/src/cordis/server.rs`, `go/rutis/dial.go`, `runtime/plugin.rs`); `--check` only scans the `现有形式化` column, so the re-extraction has to clean those too.
3. **A real hole in the register's evidence**: `loader/remote-runtime-lease` (the only `未验证` core commitment) lists `rutis-loader/tests/leases.rs`, deleted with the connection plugin (`ec47944c`); §16 of the register already says the test is to be added. The checker skips paths inside parentheses, as `tools/check-guarantees.mjs` does (there the parenthesis says there is no evidence), so the hole sits in the known blind spot of both checks.
4. **The register's §16 totals do not match its rows**: §16 says 194 current rows, the tables have 200; by section, §10 has 1 more, §12 2 more and §14 2 more. The table counts the rows; §16 needs a maintainer's check.
5. **`TRC-INV-2` (the handshake gate) has no Rust assertion**: the text `protocol handshake incomplete` is implemented and untested; Go's `TestACallBeforeTheHandshakeEndsTheSession` asserts its own words.
6. **Scope and mutation are mostly empty**: they come from the support matrix (quality standard §10) and the mutation results of #624, #630 and #631. Protocol rows carry participants in the scope column and `未登记` in the mutation column.
7. **Semantic re-extraction covers the TRC partition only**: its 44 rows are rewritten against current sources; the 1368 protocol rules have been re-checked (source, anchor, evidence, status) but their text is the issue snapshot's. The re-check page §4 says for every protocol row which `SESS-*` or current document it falls under, and §6 lists the rows with none.

## 6. Next steps

1. **Write the missing current specifications**: the 261 rules with no current source (`SYN`, the 0.9 multi-language runtimes design; `REM`, the remote-plugins design) need a 0.22 specification or an explicit non-guarantee before they can be re-extracted; the session layer's remaining differences are in `protocol-session.md` §14 G1–G6.
2. **Re-extract the remaining partitions semantically**: the `TRC` partition (44 rows) is done. The next batch is the session partition: map the 82 `SESS-*` rules to the SES, VAL, TAG, M1 and CHN rows of `rules/protocol-session.md` one by one, splitting or merging ids; `ANCHORS` still gives ranges by old section and should become per rule. Events, runtime and remote follow.
3. **Fill the evidence, drop the names that no longer resolve**: find current tests or models for the 7 rows of §5 item 2; if there is none, keep `部分验证`/`未验证` and do not treat the old issue name as evidence. Update the old paths in the note column during the re-extraction.
4. **Attach models and conformance cases**: once WS4 (`#613`), WS5 (`#624`) and WS7 (`#631`) produce TLA+ properties, the trace validator and conformance test names, they go into the evidence column, and only then can a status move up.
5. **Wire CI**: `--check` on pull requests. The "trace table references" check of #776 is this script; the "model drift" check belongs to WS4/WS8.
6. **English**: the `TRC` rows have an English per-row re-extraction and an English re-check page (`recheck-0.22.en.md`); the protocol list, the per-row re-check tables and the `ECA` rows are Chinese only. The rest of the English trace table is a gap.
