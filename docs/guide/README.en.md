## Packages

| User | Rust (crates.io) | Node (npm) | Python (PyPI) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plugin author | `rutis-sdk` (dylib plugins) | `@arcships/rutis` | `rutis` |
| Host (runs plugins) | `rutis`, `rutis-loader`, `rutis-bridge`, `rutis-dylib` | `@arcships/rutis-runtime` (Node), `@arcships/rutis-bun` (Bun) | `rutis` |
| Host without Rust | `rutis-host` | `@arcships/rutis-host` | `rutis-host` |

All of these packages, the `rutis` core and the dylib toolchain included, are released together with matching version numbers (a release train, currently 0.8). Use the same version for every rutis package.

Upgrading from 0.7: see [0.7 → 0.8](../migration-0.7-to-0.8.en.md). Projects that used `rutis-interop`: see the [migration guide](../migration-interop-to-0.7.en.md).

## Requirements

- Linux, macOS or Windows x64 (MSVC).
- Node 24 or later, or Bun 1.3 or later, for TypeScript / JavaScript plugins.
- Python 3.12 or later for Python plugins.
- Rust 1.85 or later, only when embedding rutis in Rust.
