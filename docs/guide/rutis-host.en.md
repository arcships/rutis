# rutis-host and rutis.json

`rutis-host` is a host that requires no Rust code. It assembles the core, plugin loader, local Node / Python / Go runtimes, and network connections, all driven by a `rutis.json` file. Plugin authors can use it for local development or deployment. For applications that need custom Rust services, see [Embed in a Rust application](rust-host.en.md).

## Installation

| Method | Command |
| --- | --- |
| npm | `npx @arcships/rutis-host …`, or install with `npm install -D @arcships/rutis-host` and run `npx rutis-host …` |
| PyPI | `uvx rutis-host …`, or install with `uv add --dev rutis-host` and run `uv run rutis-host …` |
| Binary | `rutis-host-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz` from GitHub Releases (Linux and macOS, x64 / arm64), or `.zip` for Windows x64 |
| crates.io | `cargo install rutis-host` |

The npm distribution includes the Node runtime (`@arcships/rutis-runtime`), and the PyPI distribution includes the Python runtime (`rutis`). They are used when the project does not provide its own runtime. Go plugins are compiled binaries: running them needs no other package and no Go toolchain.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `rutis-host run [rutis.json]` | Runs the configuration and prints each row's status changes. Press Ctrl-C to stop (see [Stopping and exit status](#stopping-and-exit-status)). |
| `rutis-host dev [directory]` | Runs a plugin project with its `rutis.dev.json` file and reloads it when files change; a Go project is rebuilt, restarting only its runtime. |
| `rutis-host check [rutis.json]` | Resolves each row and prints its version, dependencies, provided services, and configuration schema, and lists every Go binary (runtime name, SDK, plugin API, plugins). Exits with a nonzero status if a row or binary cannot run. Without `rutis.json`, checks the plugin project in the current directory. |
| `rutis-host new <name> --lang node\|bun\|python\|go` | Creates a plugin project. |
| `rutis-host go add <module>@<version> [rutis.json]` | `go install`s a plugin binary into `runtimes.go.dir` with the machine's Go toolchain. |

## Stopping and exit status

When `run` or `dev` receives a termination signal (SIGINT (Ctrl-C), SIGTERM or SIGHUP on Unix; Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Break or closing the console on Windows), it unloads every row and runtime: each plugin's cleanup runs once, the runtime processes exit, and then `rutis-host` exits.

Cleanups have a deadline, 10 seconds by default. Change it with `--shutdown-timeout <seconds>` or the `RUTIS_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` environment variable (the flag takes precedence; fractions are allowed; it must be above 0). When the deadline passes, or a second signal arrives while stopping (pressing Ctrl-C again), `rutis-host` prints the plugins that are still stopping, ends the runtime processes and the processes they started without waiting for their cleanups, and exits at once. When starting fails, what did start is stopped the same way.

| Exit status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Ended normally, including after a signal once every cleanup finished. |
| 1 | Could not start or run: invalid arguments or configuration, a runtime failed to start, a row failed to load; for `check`, a row cannot run. |
| 2 | Stopping did not finish: the deadline passed or another signal arrived while stopping, or every cleanup finished but the runtime processes did not exit in time (what is left of the deadline, at least 3 seconds). In these cases `rutis-host` ends the runtime processes and the processes they started. |

Status 2 is separate from 1 so that process managers and scripts can tell a configuration problem from a plugin whose cleanup did not finish. It is also below 126; shells use 126 and above for a program that could not be executed and for one ended by signal n (128 + n).

On Unix, a signal `rutis-host` was started ignoring (SIGHUP under `nohup`, for example) stays ignored. The runtime processes are in process groups of their own, so Ctrl-C in a terminal reaches only `rutis-host`, which unloads the rows. On Windows, they are started in console process groups of their own, which ignore Ctrl-C; Ctrl-Break and closing the console still reach them, and their cleanups may then not run, so use Ctrl-C to stop. When the console closes, Windows also ends `rutis-host` after a few seconds, whatever the deadline.

Relative paths in the file are resolved from the directory containing the file.

An unknown field is an error: the host does not start, and says the file, the line and column, and the fields allowed there. An unknown field in `rows` is a warning: the row runs (without it), and before starting the host says the file, which row, and the fields a row has. A misspelt field is never silently ignored.

### `id`

The endpoint ID of this node. Connected nodes see this name. Defaults to `host`.

### `runtimes`

| Key | Fields | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `node` | `project` (default `.`), `runtime` | Starts the Node runtime. Plugin packages are resolved from `project`'s `package.json`. Install `@arcships/rutis-runtime` there, specify it with `runtime`, or use the copy included with the npm distribution of rutis-host. |
| `bun` | `project` (default `.`), `runtime`, `program` | Starts the Bun runtime, with rows named `bun:<module>`. Modules resolve from `project` (packages in `node_modules`, `./relative-paths`). Install `@arcships/rutis-bun` there or specify it with `runtime`; `program` is the Bun executable, by default `bun` on `PATH`. See [Write a Bun plugin](bun-plugin.en.md). |
| `py` | `project` (default `.`), `python` | Starts the Python runtime. The interpreter defaults to `$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/python`, then `<project>/.venv/bin/python`, then `python3` (on Windows, `Scripts\python.exe` and `python`). Its environment must contain `rutis` and the plugins. |
| `go` | `dir`, `binaries`, `start` (`on-demand` by default / `eager`), `idle` (seconds, default 60), `project` (default `.`) | Go plugins: one runtime process per binary. Every executable in `dir` that contains the Go SDK's marker counts (the directory is trusted as a whole and should be dedicated); `binaries` lists single files. A runtime is named after its file (`netkit` → `go-netkit`). An on-demand runtime starts when a row first uses it and stops after `idle` seconds without one; `eager` starts all and keeps them running (not together with `idle`). A replaced binary takes effect when the host restarts. |
| `remote` | `name`, `language` | A runtime on another machine, connected through a node row with `"runtime": "<name>"`; see [Connect nodes](nodes.en.md). |

If a runtime package is missing, startup fails and prints an installation command.

### `listen`

WebSocket listeners used by other nodes to connect. `cert` and `key` are a TLS certificate and private key in PEM format; they can also be supplied through `RUTIS_CERT` and `RUTIS_KEY` (the file's own come first). They go together: with only one of them the host does not start, rather than listening without TLS. A listener without TLS can bind only to a loopback address.

### `rows`

Each row runs a plugin:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Row name, unique within this file. |
| `name` | Plugin identifier: an npm package (or package subpath), `py:<name>` (Python entry point or module), `bun:<module>` (a module in the Bun runtime), `go:<plugin>` (the Go binary that has it; `go-<binary name>:<plugin>` when two do), `./relative-path` (plugin file), `<remote-runtime>:<module or plugin>`, `rutis-bridge/peer` (a node; see [Connect nodes](nodes.en.md)), or `peer:<node>/<plugin>` (a plugin running on another node). |
| `config` | Plugin configuration. |
| `inject` | Additional service names to wait for. |
| `isolate` | `{ "service": true }` gives this row its own instance of the service; `{ "service": "label" }` shares one instance among rows with that label. |
| `disabled` | When `true`, the row does not run. |

Services are shared by name across all plugins. Any plugin that declares `inject: ["weather"]` can use a `weather` service provided in any language or on any node.

## Credentials

Do not put credentials in the file:

| Environment variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `RUTIS_TOKEN` | Token presented when connecting to other nodes and checked when accepting connections. |
| `RUTIS_TOKEN_<NODE>` | Token for a specific node (uppercase, with `-` written as `_`); takes precedence over `RUTIS_TOKEN`. |
| `RUTIS_CA` | Additional trusted CA certificate in PEM format for `wss://` connections. |
| `RUTIS_CERT` / `RUTIS_KEY` | Listener certificate and key when they are not specified under `listen`. |

## Deployment

Place `rutis.json`, the Node project (with plugins and `@arcships/rutis-runtime` installed), the Python environment (with `rutis` and plugins installed), and the Go plugin directory (binaries for the platform) together. Run `rutis-host run /srv/app/rutis.json` under a process manager such as systemd. When `rutis-host` exits, the runtime processes it started exit as well.

When stopping, have the process manager send SIGTERM to `rutis-host` alone and let it unload the rows. By default (`KillMode=control-group`), systemd also sends SIGTERM to the runtime processes, which then exit before their cleanups run; set `KillMode=mixed`, and set `TimeoutStopSec` longer than the cleanup deadline. If `rutis-host` is killed (SIGKILL, or ending the process on Windows), it cannot unload the rows: on Windows, the runtime processes are ended with it; on Unix, they notice that their channel closed, unload their rows themselves, and exit.
