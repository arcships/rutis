// The session's frame pump, driven by the test (#630, formal verification
// design §3.3: "Node/Bun: frame pump, synchronous wait, re-entrancy, event
// delivery and cancellation").
//
// `Session` takes its transport as a seam: `send` for frames out, `pump` for
// frames the synchronous wait of a call reads, `receive` for the frames the
// far end sends. So pause, lateness, cancel and close are decided here, never
// by how fast the machine is: no test below waits on a timer, and a pump asked
// past its script throws instead of spinning the thread.
//
// What this does not cover: the process's own pump (`receiveMessageOnPort`
// plus `Atomics.wait`, src/client.mjs:30-35) and the runner around it.
// runner.mjs is a script, not a factory, so the runner-level frame pump has no
// test yet — it is the gap #630 names for Node and Bun ("runner.mjs 要先改成
// 工厂").
