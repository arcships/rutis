/**
 * An application hosting rutis plugins (design-android-runtime §五): once
 * connected it offers rutis the `services` family and installs [plugins],
 * in order, each with its configuration ([configs], by plugin name; without
 * one, its schema's defaults) once every service it injects is there (its
 * own plugins' or rutis's); the services they provide reach rutis, as
 * `<id>:<plugin>`, once rutis offers `services`
 * (docs/design-remote-session-2026-10-28.md §2.6, decision 2).
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val rutis = RutisApp(
 *     plugins = listOf(contacts, notify, device),
 *     configs = mapOf("notify" to NotifyConfig(channel = "rutis sample")),
 *     connect = "wss://rutis.example.com:7443/rutis",
 *     id = "kim-pixel",
 *     token = secrets.rutisToken,
 * )
 * rutis.start()   // connects, installs the plugins, and stays connected until stop()
 * rutis.stop()    // every plugin's cleanups in reverse, then disconnects
 * ```
 *
 * [connect] dials a rutis access point (recommended: the application is
 * behind NAT, its address changes); [listen] waits for rutis to dial in
 * instead (a device with a fixed address), one controller at a time, a newer
 * connection taking over. A non-loopback address needs `wss://`: [trust]
 * holds the PEM certificates of CAs trusted besides the system's, for a
 * self-signed access point; [certificate] the PEM certificate chain and
 * private key a `wss://` listener serves. [id] is this connection's
 * self-reported id (`[a-z0-9-]+`): rutis registers its plugins as `<id>:<plugin>`; [token] the
 * shared token rutis expects; [peer] rutis's own id, when it must be checked.
 *
 * The SDK only connects: when to [start] and [stop] (foreground,
 * background, a foreground service) is the application's business. Lost
 * connections are dialed again by the rules every runtime follows
 * (0.5 s doubling up to 30 s; 30 s after refused credentials); every
 * connection is a new session: the plugins clean up when one is lost,
 * latest first, and are installed again on the next.
 * [state] says where it stands; the SDK decides nothing by it.
