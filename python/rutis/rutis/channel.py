"""Channels a session runs on: ordered, reliable messages with their
boundaries kept, independent of the encoding of what they carry.

A channel has `send(message: bytes)`, `recv() -> bytes | None` (blocking;
`None` once the far end finished) and `close(reason)`. `recv` raises
`ConnectionError` when the channel failed.
